Entro Proof is a casino-to-player provable fairness algorithm.

This repository contains the source code in C99.

[This page](https://entrocraft.com/saloon/entro-proof/) contains downloads in other programming languages and further explanation.

To verify fair play on casinos using Entro Proof, either build a custom verification interface from the open-source code or complete a [one-time purchase for credits](https://entrocraft.com/pricing/) and verify the copied-and-pasted data from each game round using [Saloon](https://entrocraft.com/saloon/).
